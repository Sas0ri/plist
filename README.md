plist
=====

Quick and dirty implementation of Apple's binary plist format.

This was written to facilitate a command line app to edit shopping lists from the ShopShop iOS app (which stores its lists in binary1 plist format in a DropBox folder).

For general use it needs:

- Tests
- Implementation of more data types (e.g. Date)
- Handling of XML plist format
